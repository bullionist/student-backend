# AI-Powered Student Counseling Platform - Frontend Requirements

## Project Overview
The AI-Powered Student Counseling Platform is a web application that helps students receive personalized counseling and program recommendations. The platform uses AI (via Groq API) to analyze student inputs and provide structured guidance.

## Technical Stack Requirements
- React/Next.js for the frontend framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- Supabase Client for authentication and data management
- Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Query for API state management
- Axios or fetch for API calls

## Authentication
- Implement Supabase Email OTP authentication
- Protected routes for authenticated users
- Admin role-based access control
- Session management and token handling

## Core Features

### 1. Student Dashboard
- Student profile management
- Conversation history with AI counselor
- Program recommendations display
- Academic background information
- Preferred location and field of study preferences

### 2. Program Management (Admin Only)
- CRUD operations for educational programs
- Program listing and filtering
- Program details view
- Program analytics

### 3. AI Counseling Interface
- Real-time chat interface with AI
- Input analysis and structured data extraction
- Progress tracking
- Session history

## API Integration

### Base URL
```
http://localhost:8000/api
```

### Authentication Endpoints
- Supabase authentication endpoints (handled by Supabase client)

### Program Endpoints
```
GET    /api/programs          - List all programs
POST   /api/programs          - Create new program (admin only)
GET    /api/programs/{id}     - Get program details
PUT    /api/programs/{id}     - Update program (admin only)
DELETE /api/programs/{id}     - Delete program (admin only)
```

### Student Endpoints
```
POST   /api/students          - Create new student session
GET    /api/students/{id}     - Get student details
POST   /api/students/{id}/analyze - Analyze student input
```

## Data Models

### Program
```typescript
interface Program {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  // Add other program fields
}
```

### Student
```typescript
interface Student {
  id: string;
  academic_background?: string;
  preferred_location?: string;
  field_of_study?: string;
  exam_scores?: Record<string, number>;
  additional_preferences?: string;
  conversation_history: {
    messages: Array<{
      role: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system';
      content: string;
      timestamp: string;
    }>;
  };
}
```

## UI/UX Requirements

### 1. Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints: xs, sm, md, lg, xl
- Fluid layouts
- Touch-friendly interfaces

### 2. Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 compliance
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- High contrast mode
- Proper ARIA labels

### 3. Performance
- Lazy loading of components
- Image optimization
- Caching strategies
- Progressive Web App capabilities

### 4. Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Offline support
- Loading states
- Retry mechanisms

## State Management
- Global state for user authentication
- Local state for form handling
- Cache management for API responses
- Real-time updates for chat

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for API calls
- End-to-end testing
- Accessibility testing
- Performance testing

## Security Considerations
- Secure storage of tokens
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection
- Input sanitization
- Secure communication with backend

## Development Workflow
1. Set up development environment
2. Implement authentication flow
3. Create core components
4. Integrate with backend APIs
5. Add AI counseling features
6. Implement admin features
7. Add testing
8. Performance optimization
9. Documentation

## Environment Setup
